# 4a13
Resources for the course 4A13: Combustion and Engines (Part IIB Engineering Tripos) at Cambridge, based on 2021/22 lectures by N. Swaminathan and S. Hochgreb. 

What is included: Exam prep (past papers and cribs, a compilation of typical questions and their answers), lecture material (lecture presentations and class notes, two corrected example papers), miscellaneous supplementary material, personal notes (summary of the first part of the course with key concepts and equations).

All mistakes are probably mine :-)
